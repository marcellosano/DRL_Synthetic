# Focus on reward modifications
reward:
  # Test: Strong early warning incentives
  lives_saved_weight: 15.0      # Increased from 10.0
  early_warning_bonus: 10.0     # Doubled from 5.0
  false_alarm_penalty: -5.0     # Increased penalty from -2.0

  # Economic considerations
  economic_cost_weight: -0.05   # Reduced from -0.1 (less cost sensitive)
  resource_efficiency_bonus: 2.0 # Increased from 1.0

  # Time-based rewards
  time_penalty_factor: -0.2     # Increased urgency
  quick_response_bonus: 7.0     # Much higher quick response reward

  # Multi-objective reweighting (testing safety-first approach)
  objective_weights:
    safety: 0.8      # Increased from 0.6
    economy: 0.1     # Decreased from 0.2
    efficiency: 0.1  # Decreased from 0.2

# Longer training to see reward effects
training:
  episodes: 2000
  log_frequency: 20  # More detailed logging for reward analysis
